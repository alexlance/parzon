# Parzon - DNS zone file parser

*"Hey, you know how zone files have this god-awful archaic unparsible syntax - with lots of
corner cases and syntactical quirks?"*


### Synopsis

Given a dns zone file that is compatible with RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1), Parzon
attempts to break down the components of the file and provide an interface for querying zone information.


### Features

* 

* 


### Quick start

> python -m parzon -f FILE -o names

And take a quick look at the options:

> python -m parzon --help

Note: if you run *python setup.py install --user* it will build a standalone
parzon binary in ~/.local/bin/.
